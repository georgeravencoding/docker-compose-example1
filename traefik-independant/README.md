# docker-compose Traefik "independant"

> POC of a Traefik without labels, only a full dynamic configuration and in another folder !

It's easy to manage for all your containers and no need to refresh/reload your compose file. You just have to save the dynamic conf file and it's done.

This stack is a multipurpose environment : you'll have a specific stack for Traefik and Prometheus in a folder, and another stack (wordpress) in another folder.

## :factory: Requirements

* linux host (tested successfully on Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 10 & 11)
* docker >= 18.x
* docker-compose >= 1.26

## :rocket: How to use

Clone this repo where you want with this line :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mettmett/docker-compose.git:traefik-independant
```

You need to edit the file `.env` at the source folder to modify the values of some vars.

Don't forget to create some networks before create your containers.

```bash
docker network create --subnet 172.16.1.0/24 --driver bridge oueb

docker network create --subnet 192.168.10.0/24 backend
```

After that when you're all set, press the red button to initiate :fire: !

```bash
cd dc && docker-compose pull; docker-compose up -d; docker-compose logs -f

cd ../blog && docker-compose pull; docker-compose up -d; docker-compose logs -f
```
